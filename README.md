# ff, simple binary file scanner

ff aims to be a simple, fast, generic, and understandable binary file scanner.

Warning: This tool is not memory safe and will not work on big-endian (MSB)
platforms.

# Compiling

There is a Makefile defaulting to clang. It will work with gcc aswell: `make CC=gcc`.

It's usually best to use `build-clang.cmd` on Windows, as you can add additional arguments easily. 
Reminder that you should add `-O3` (or `/Ot` for cl).
There is also `build-clang.sh` as an alternative to the Makefile for Unix-like systems.

However, if you want to define your own arguments:

You **MUST**:
- Byte-align structs
  - cl, clang-cl: `/Zp`
  - clang, gcc: `-fpack-struct=1`

## File Globbing on Windows

If you wish to include file globbing, throw in `setargv.obj` alongside the
build script. This object file is included with your Visual Studio install.
Don't forget to use the proper target architecture.
